# Semantic versioning example

bumpversion flow:

    1.0.0 => 1.0.1-dev0 => 1.0.1-dev1 = > 1.0.1-rc0 => 1.0.1-rc1 => 1.0.1
             patch         build          release      build        release


## Details

Start with an initial release, say `1.0.0`.

1. Starting a new development cycle by bumping `patch` only once!

        $ bumpversion patch --no-commit
        git tag => v1.0.1-dev0
        CMake PROJECT_VERSION => 1.0.1(.0)?

2. Every time you build, bump `build`.

        $ bumpversion build --no-tag
        git tag => v1.0.1-dev1
        CMake PROJECT_VERSION => 1.0.1.1

3. Go to release candidate by bumping `release` only once!

        $ bumpversion release --no-commit
        git tag => v1.0.1-rc0
        CMake PROJECT_VERSION => 1.0.1(.0)?

4. With every new build, bump `build`.

        $ bumpversion build --tag
        git tag => v1.0.1-rc1
        CMake PROJECT_VERSION => 1.0.1.1

4. Finally, bump `release` to generate a final release for the current
   `major` / `minor` / `patch` version.

        $ bumpversion release --tag
        git tag => v1.0.1
        CMake PROJECT_VERSION => 1.0.1


## Notes

* Once the final release has been reached, it is not possible to bump
  the `release` before bumping `patch` again. Trying to bump the release
  while in final release state will issue
  `ValueError: The part has already the maximum value among ['dev', 'rc', 'ga'] and cannot be bumped`.
* A whole version string may be set with:

    bumpversion --new-version 11.1.1-dev1 --no-tag release
